¦ After a very serious problem I was having with WinAMP         ¦
¦ and it causing my computer to crash several times i was       ¦
¦ determined to make a good MP3 player similar to it            ¦
¦ without all the nonsense added. Piro's Playlist does          ¦
¦ most everything that WinAMP does except the things that       ¦
¦ would cause your computer to lag excessivley and crash.       ¦
¦                                                               ¦
¦ Errors: None                                                  ¦
¦ Bugs: The time doesnt change when you scroll the trackbar.    ¦
¦       Program often doesn't play ALL Mp3s first try, or ever  ¦
¦       due to this shuffle and loop buttons don't always work  ¦
¦       correctly.                                              ¦
